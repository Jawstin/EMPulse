# EMPulse 
(Haptic book of babel)
by Jawstin, May 2021

## Description :
Electro Magnetic Pulse is a simple experimentation with a coil woven to a piece of textile that pulse thanks to a magnet and different current intensities.This code has 4 different mode, the first one transcribe in binary pulses random chartacters, while the second one does it in morse. The third is a sinwave and the last a simple vibration.

This work was done at ENSAD to experiment with arduino, e-textile and 3D printing (case) and was inspired with the concept of haptic communication and Jorge Borges themes (The Library of Babel and Book of sand).
